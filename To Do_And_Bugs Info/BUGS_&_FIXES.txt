* TO DO and bugs to be fixed after initial requirements of the project *

*****Database Improvement: (IMPORTANT!)use: Proper Database Design.png*****
	-Change from 1 table into new design/multiple tables (note: need to research)
	-Dont need a "ID" field (auto generates)

****FRONT END****
	-Adjust table and text to auto scale based on browser window size
	-Better color palette
	-Implement Pechanga Logo
	-Include pics of employees in another field of the DB (put a face to the name concept)
	-

****BACK END****
	-Username & password requirement to enter the "Admin Portal"
	-Implement employee search field better (One function, called on both admin and user pages)
	-Error handling for create/edit (Restrict name field to only character and badge# to only ints etc.)
	-Make email hyperlinks of users, when clicked, open outlook compose email
	-Search Bar crashes if NULL value in DB (i mean shouldnt have a null in proper DB anyway)
	-Change delete empid feature, its ID is off for some reason
	-Do not allow more than 1 employee ID
	-no negative for employee id


****BUGS FOUND****
	-Can enter digits in name fields
	-Title is still a button when clicked (top left corner)
	-Need to require all fields completed for CREATE method to not crash
